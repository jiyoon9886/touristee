## touristee

## ‘Touristee’ is an app that suggests restaurants and points of interest based on their proximity to the user, with the goal of assisting user decision making and planning.

## Such a service is especially useful in a metropolis such as New York City, where newcomers, as well as locals, may find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings.
